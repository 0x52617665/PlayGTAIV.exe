# PlayGTAIV

This utility is a drop in replacement of `PlayGTAIV.exe` for use with Steam copies of GTAIV that have been downgraded to 1.0.8.0 or below.

## Prerequisites

A cracked `LaunchGTAIV.exe` located in the GTAIV game directory is required as steam no longer takes care of Securom licensing.

## Installation

Download [PlayGTAIV.exe](https://github.com/jfoster/PlayGTAIV/releases) and drop it into your GTAIV game directory alongside `LaunchGTAIV.exe`.
